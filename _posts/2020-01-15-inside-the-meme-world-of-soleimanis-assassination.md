The killing of Soleimani spawned lots of reactions around the world. Many saw the operation as an illegal and irresponsible action by Trump that could set the whole middle east on fire.

On the other hand, Many from the middle east are praising the death of Soleimani. The fact is that Soleimani was responsible through his militias of the death of hundreds of thousands of human beings in Iraq, Iran, and Syria. Many people in the middle east consider his death as a relief. People start to circulate memes all over social media praising the operation.

Some found the event a good start into 2020.<br>![](/uploads/screenshot-2020-01-10-at-01-14-31.png)

There is a big dispute in the US and the west whether the killing of Soleimani is the right thing to do or not, and despite the enormous anger that this operation caused for people in the middle east, the picture there is quite different. Many Iranians along Iraqis and Syrians cheer up the operation and in Iran people went to the street to demonstrate their regime. The sees that their government is promoting an anti-American propaganda that they think this is not in their national interest.

It is a practice in Iran that the regime put the American and the Israeli flag on the floor so people would on them. People have been protesting this behavious by avoiding to stepping on the flags.
